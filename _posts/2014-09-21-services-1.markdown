The sound wheel enables audio professionals to gradually streamline the vocabulary for sound, not only by using a common set of words but just as importantly, by having a common understanding of the meaning of those words, as each one comes with a definition. It can help both audio professionals and members of listener panels to talk about sound using a common language.
